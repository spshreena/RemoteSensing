# Intro to Remote Sensing 

 In this project we used remote sensing to provide an environmental characterization of Mass Audubon Wildlife Sanctuaries in Central Massachusetts using Landsat ETM (2000-2003)

**Goals of the Project:**
> 1. Identify NDVI, EVI, NDWI, NDBI (normalized difference built-up index) within site and in 500m, 1000m, 1500m, 2000m, 2500m, 3000m buffers
> 2. 	Create a supervised classification of the site
